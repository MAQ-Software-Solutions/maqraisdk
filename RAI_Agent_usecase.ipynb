    "## Overview\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates the capabilities of the **RAI (Responsible AI) Agent** - a comprehensive system designed to ensure AI prompts comply with responsible AI principles and safety guidelines.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Components:\n",
    "1. **PromptReviewer**: Analyzes prompts for potential RAI violations and compliance issues\n",
    "2. **PromptUpdater**: Updates prompts based on review feedback to ensure RAI compliance\n",
    "3. **PromptTestcaseGenerator**: Generates test cases to evaluate prompt robustness against various attack scenarios\n",
    "\n",
    "### RAI Principles Covered:\n",
    "- **Groundedness**: Ensuring responses are based on provided data/context\n",
    "- **XPIA (Cross-Prompt Injection Attack)**: Protection against prompt manipulation attempts\n",
    "- **Jailbreak Prevention**: Resistance to attempts to bypass safety guardrails\n",
    "- **Harmful Content Prevention**: Blocking generation of offensive, violent, or discriminatory content\n",
