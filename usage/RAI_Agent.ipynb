    "## Overview\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates the capabilities of the **RAI (Responsible AI) Agent** - a comprehensive system designed to ensure AI prompts comply with responsible AI principles and safety guidelines.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Components:\n",
    "1. **PromptReviewer**: Analyzes prompts for potential RAI violations and compliance issues\n",
    "2. **PromptUpdater**: Updates prompts based on review feedback to ensure RAI compliance\n",
    "3. **PromptTestcaseGenerator**: Generates test cases to evaluate prompt robustness against various attack scenarios\n",
    "\n",
    "### RAI Principles Covered:\n",
    "- **Groundedness**: Ensuring responses are based on provided data/context\n",
    "- **XPIA (Cross-Prompt Injection Attack)**: Protection against prompt manipulation attempts\n",
    "- **Jailbreak Prevention**: Resistance to attempts to bypass safety guardrails\n",
    "- **Harmful Content Prevention**: Blocking generation of offensive, violent, or discriminatory content\n",

Furthermore, the prompt includes a refusal policy for 'offensive, discriminatory, or threatening content,' which helps defend against malicious user prompts. These instructions collectively provide a robust defense against Groundedness attacks, as they require the model to reference only factual information from specified sources and to reject inappropriate requests. For example, if a user attempts to elicit fictional product details or unsupported order information, the system prompt guides the model to refuse such requests and remain grounded in the actual data.

    "## Summary and Key Takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook has demonstrated the comprehensive capabilities of the **RAI Agent** across two critical use cases:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Use Case 1: E-commerce Support Chatbot\n",
    "- **Challenge**: Customer service AI requiring comprehensive RAI compliance across all four scenarios\n",
    "- **RAI Focus**: Groundedness, XPIA protection, Jailbreak prevention, Harmful content filtering\n",
    "- **Specific Testing**: Individual scenario analysis with targeted prompts for each RAI area\n",
    "- **Result**: Comprehensive RAI-compliant support chatbot with multi-scenario protection\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key RAI Scenarios Addressed\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Groundedness\n",
    "- **Purpose**: Ensures responses are based only on verifiable, provided data\n",
    "- **Testing**: Validates that AI doesn't fabricate or hallucinate information\n",
    "- **Implementation**: Explicit requirements to stick to factual, available information\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. XPIA (Cross-Prompt Injection Attack)\n",
    "- **Purpose**: Protects against attempts to manipulate the AI through prompt injection\n",
    "- **Testing**: Resistance to commands that try to override original instructions\n",
    "- **Implementation**: Strong guardrails against instruction manipulation\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Jailbreak Prevention\n",
    "- **Purpose**: Prevents attempts to bypass safety protocols and system rules\n",
    "- **Testing**: Validates that the AI maintains its role and constraints under pressure\n",
    "- **Implementation**: Robust adherence to defined roles and boundaries\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Harmful Content Prevention\n",
    "- **Purpose**: Blocks generation of inappropriate, offensive, or harmful content\n",
    "- **Testing**: Ensures the AI refuses harmful requests and maintains professional standards\n",
    "- **Implementation**: Clear content guidelines and refusal mechanisms\n",
    "\n",
    "## Benefits of RAI Agent Implementation\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Comprehensive Risk Coverage**: Addresses all four critical RAI scenarios systematically\n",
    "2. **Proactive Risk Mitigation**: Identifies and fixes issues before deployment\n",
    "3. **Scenario-Specific Analysis**: Individual evaluation of Groundedness, XPIA, Jailbreak, and Harmful Content\n",
    "4. **Regulatory Compliance**: Ensures adherence to industry standards\n",
    "5. **Interactive Testing**: User-controlled test case generation for targeted validation\n",
    "6. **Scalable Solution**: Efficient processing of multiple prompts and use cases\n",
    "7. **Continuous Improvement**: Iterative enhancement through detailed feedback loops\n",
    "\n",
    "The RAI Agent provides a complete solution for building responsible, safe, and compliant AI systems across any domain, with particular strength in multi-scenario RAI compliance validation."
